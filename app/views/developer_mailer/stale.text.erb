Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

Joe, solo-founder of railsdevs (<%= root_url %>) here. It looks like your developer profile hasn't been updated in a while. Is everything still accurate?

If not, you can update your profile (<%= edit_developer_url(@developer) %>). Or, if you've found a gig and are no longer looking let me know by replying to this email!

To stop receiving these emails, please change your notification settings (<%= developer_notifications_url(@developer) %>).
