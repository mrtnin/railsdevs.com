<p>Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,</p>

<p>Joe, solo-founder of <%= link_to "railsdevs", root_url %> here. It looks like your developer profile hasn't been updated in a while. Is everything still accurate?</p>

<p>If not, you can <%= link_to "update your profile", edit_developer_url(@developer) %>. Or, if you've found a gig and are no longer looking let me know by replying to this email!</p>

<p>To stop receiving these emails, please <%= link_to "change your notification settings", developer_notifications_url(@developer) %>.</p>
